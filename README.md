The goal of this iteration was to implement middleware for validation, automated testing, logging, and centralized error handling. Ultimately, increasing security, and transferability to other devs down the road. Had some fun getting this one live on Google Cloud as well.

This back-end project focused on setting up backend security for the WTWR application. This was accomplished by expanding the user schema with an email and password, creating routes and controllers for signing up, signing in, and for modifying the current user data. As well as protecting existing routes through authorization.
