# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. I set up routing, controllers, validation, and database creation. It was a blast seeing it all work! Especially after iterating corrections that allowed it to pass automated server testing.

Now the database can create new users, like items, create new items, delete items, and more!
